# Fair Participation.

One of the basic principles in eDemocracy should be Fair Participation.

I gave (together with Cyril Velikanov) a talk on Fair Participation in 2011. You can [see it on my webpage](http://home.pietrosperoni.it/index.php/research/epart/2011comsoc/).

The basic idea is:

How can we make a system where everybody has the possibility to have his voice heard. This is rooted on an issue of human fairness, but not only. We need to be able to give to everybody the possibility to speak because anybody can have the solution to the question we are asking. And because each person represents a different point of view. And often avoiding hearing a person becomes avoiding hearing a point of view. 

What we ant to have is **a system where the best solutions are extracted independently of who wrote them**. The system should not have any bias on the base of the richness of the person, how socially connected he is, when does he write his proposal and so on.

Let us look at two particular cases:

In many modern eDemocracy system each proposal has an URL associated to it. And by going to that URL a person can vote for that proposal. This results in people sending a link to all their friends, asking them to vote for him. Then the voting stage stops being an evaluation of which proposal is best and becomes a popularity contest.
