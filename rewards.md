# Should we reward participation?



What we are trying to achieve is a system that uses everybody's input in society to find out the best result. Not for the best result for one particular person, but when possible for the best result for the whole of society. The best result for everybody. This might not always be possible. In fact this might not even exists at time. But we should still look for it, and start under the assumption that it exists. Employ a method that helps us find it, if it exists.

But there is a principle behind all this. Lets call this the optimality principle.

We should not reward people who participate more with more political power. We should not reward them with giving them more ability to participate or more ability to reach their own solution.

Consider this: the solution that we want to reach is out there. Somehow sits comfortably in its space of solutions. Each person sees some part of it. Yes, it is true that a person that has participated more might have a better grasp of it. But we should not simply assume that just the fact of participating more makes a person see it clearly. It might or might not. Someone can participate in a discussion for very long and just not have the mental elasticity to see things from others point of view.

Nor should we assume good faith. Not in this subject. A person might be technical enough to see the best solution and be instead secretly interested in having HIS agenda be accepted by the community. In fact the more we give power as a reward to people that participate the more the system will tend to attract that kind of people.

We can still reward those people, just not with power. We can reward them with respect. We can reward them with money. And sometimes respect can become money when a person receives job offers because of his fame (or writes a book out of his experience).

I have spoken in other places about the principle of fairness, and this is somehow tied with it. The principle of fair participation tries to make sure that everybody has an equal say on the solution we are looking for. But this is not just because it is 'nice' and 'cute'. But because not doing this might prevent us from reaching the optimal solution. And then the fairness of the reward system (if we need one) should not happen inside the system.

So the other side of the fairness coin is that it is needed to reach the optimal solution. 

But could this prevent us from reaching it?

This is also an important question. Being too concentrated on giving a voice to everybody could take away the voice from the experts, the people who know more and by sharing it can help everybody?

In theory yes, but this depends on how the system is designed. Again it is a design issue. **Technicians, should help others understand**. This not only helps people to see what the solution is, but also educates them. On the other side a representative system where you elect the technician you like best is a system that tend to generate a caste of technicians that speak in their own private language. And a caste of ignorants, unable to understand them. We should instead make a system where technicians help non technical people. And non technical people must make the effort to understand to be able to participate fully. Everybody must make an effort, in one way or the other. In this sense participation does not come for free.

So we should not give direct political power to technicians, because the non technicians (always the majority of the society because no one can be technically knowledgeable in all fields) would not be able to understand if the technicians are doing their job right. But we should also not discard them. They represent too much an asset for the community. Instead the technician should educate the others, and then we should all decide together.

It could look like the idea of educating others would be too difficult or too long to do. But we don't need them to educate others in the whole subject, just in that particular solution they are commenting.

But how are we to judge who is a technician, an expert, and who is not? We shouldn't. An expert should be a person who is able to explain not just his idea, but others ideas too. He should understand them, and explain them. And we should expect him to do that. 

Now, a person who have participated more than others has become some sort of expert. An expert on that particular question. He or she might not just have developed an expertise on the subject discussed, but on the position people presented as well. Having read multiple opinions might put him or her in the position to be better able to grasp the possible synergies, integrations, or compromises necessary to find an accepted solution. In short what kind of solution could be accepted by everybody. And not just to find this solution, but to explain it. Or to explain it to others if someone else found it.

But as for all the other experts we should not give this type of expert any extra power. We should take note of the effort they do in explaining to others. So this might be rewarded outside. But inside the system the person should be just like everybody else.
