# fair evaluatin√¨on of new versions of a proposal.

One of the main problem in building an e-democratic system is how to let people modify proposals, and then have those proposal be evaluated ina  fair way.

New version of a proposal must be evaluated fairly not just respect to other proposals but also to previous versions of the same proposal. And by evaluated fairly I mean, if there was a poll among two propals, and we ask n persons which one would they chose. And the two proposals are presented to them at the same time, then we would get a certain result. We want to get to the same 8or at least similar) result even though: proposals are arriving at different times. Some proposals are already well known to the public.

This problem also includes who has the right to change a proposal. And who can change it, while retaining the votes it had.

We start by showing some of the possibilities that have been used around:

## each proposal is independent

In this solution each new version of a proposal starts from zero, and does not results having any connection with the previous versions.

**Positive Aspects**:

* No one has any special rights on the proposals
* If the system to evaluate proposals in different times is well done, this might be the best (in terms of fairness) system.

**Negative Aspects**:

* It's a very slow system
* The system ignores all the information gathered before. As such it is very inefficient.
* It forces people to vote several slightly differen versions of the same proposal.

## Each proposal has an author who is the only one who has the right to change it

This is the system used by LiquidFeedback and suggested for Airesis. It is essentially a hidden representative system.

**Positive Aspects**:

* It's a fairly fast system.

**Negative Aspects**:

* who votes for a proposal must contantly keep the eyes open in case the person who has written the proposal decides to change it. In a sense it is a system where we don't so much vote for a proposal but give power to the author to bring forward the proposal for us
* if the author of a proposal does not like a suggestion, there is no way to force him. He becomes the ultimate bottleneck.

## When someone writes a new proposal this gets tested on on few people at a time.

It is a system unknown to the most. A version of it was used by White House 2. The idea is that a person changes a proposal around which there is a great consensus. The new proposal gets presented to various people who have approved the previous one. If enough people are available to support the new version, this gets presented to more people. And so on.

**Positive Aspects**:

* It is a fairly fast system.
* It does not tie a person to a proposal. Everybody is on the same plane and new proposals can come from anyone.

**Negative Aspects**:

* how many people must test a proposal? How many people must like a proposal for it to be presented to everybody? This system depends on the value of those two constants. And each value will give a slightly different *taste* of democracy.
* It requires that the people get recontacted fairly regularly to say if they agree with the new version. (A variation does not require this. Instead requires that if a percentage high enough of the people - say 70% - declares himself to agree with the new version, this gets applied to everybody. The risk is to find yourself supporting a proposal you do not agree with).

## Proposals are distributed and evaluated on a system similar to GitHub.

This system hasn't been tested yet. But the idea would be that anyone can write a proposal, support a proposal, but also fork an existing proposal. Each person who is following a proposal could be made aware of the possible forks, and decide wich versions to support.

**Positive Aspects**:

* It does not tie a person to a proposal. Everybody is on the same plane. And new proposals can come from anybody.

**Negative Aspects**:

* The system seems complex, and so far no one has done it.
* it requires a participation from the voters, and requires to give them instruments powerful enough and elastic enough to say:
** Accept any proposal from this person
** Accept this phrase. And if I accept a proposal and a new version of it has been made (only) adding this phrase, accept the new version as well. 

# When to switch.

Essentially the problem is to write well the algorithm that decides when a person should support a new proposal. Probably the best idea is to let people come out with their own rules, and give them some basic tools to build those rules. Here are a few possible rules. Note that some of those rules effectively make up a representative system. So disallowing some of those rules might protect the system from letting people give up their judgmental ability.

* Support any new proposal from the author of a proposal, if I support his or her previous proposal.
* Accept any proposal from this person 
* Accept this phrase. And if I accept a proposal and a new version of it has been made (only) adding this phrase, accept the new version as well. 
* Support any new proposal from the author of a proposal, I support his or her previous proposal and if at least x% of people support the new proposal. *NOTE: This type of rules effectively create landslide behaviour. Something similar to what a MOB would do: if enough people think in a particular way, then I do not have to evaluate the proposal.*

# Differences between the GitHub and the WhiteHouse 2 system

In a sense the two systems are very similar. In both everyone can create proposals. In both everybody can create proposals, and everybody can update existing proposals from everybody else. The WhiteHouse2 system is a more centralised system. It is the central system that decides under which conditions to present a proposal to many people. While in the GitHub system each person defines its own set of rules.
